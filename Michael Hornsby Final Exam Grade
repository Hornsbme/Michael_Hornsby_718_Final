General comments:

You are becoming an excellent R coder! Continuing to work on your coding, as well as proper documentation,
will serve you well throughout your professional career. You also do a great job selecting graphs and
statistics. This is a powerful combination with coding skills. Overall, this was a great project! It has
been a pleasure having you in the course this semester.

Total score: 97



Reproducibilty: 9

Correctly initiated a repo, established a .gitignore file, and tracked the project with descriptive comments.
Readme file is sparse and not descriptive for outsiders.

Neatness: 10

A well-documented and well-formatted project with appropriate narrative. Adherence to the style guide throughout the
notebook. Very clean, readable output.

Functions: 14

Functions work correctly and are well-documented. Notebook must be run before running main notebook for this to work.
Putting the functions in a script and sourcing at the top of the notebook would be better.

Data prep: 14

All data read in, checked for primary keys, found bad key in GPA, removed highest residuals, scored Likert items
correctly, and joined all files. Only minor error is that further exploration would have shown bad key to be a typo
so that two rows of data could have been retained.

Graphs: 15

Graphs are attractive, well-labeled, and appropriate for investigating the research questions.

Descriptive statistics: 15

Descriptive statistics are well-chosen and correct. They are nicely tabled to provide further details about what is
displayed in the graph. Statistics answer the research questions.

Inferential statistics: 15

Inferential statistics are correctely calculated and interpreted.

Team collaboration: 5

Pull request to correct branch with productive recommendations included.
